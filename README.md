# Robotic Garden Project

## Introduction
The vision for this project is to produce an automated watering system for an outdoor garden, with some form of visual reporting and control accessible via a local LAN web interface. The value is to help me learn more about the Raspberry PI, hobby projects, UI design, and to keep the garden watered whilst away on holiday. The project is limited to watering the equivalent of a few raised beds, using just the ourdoor tap and some electronics.
