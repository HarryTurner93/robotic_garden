Quite simple. Did it rain yesterday, no, then water. Uses PVC pipes and puts them underground. Uses a solenoid valve with MOSFET. Raspberry PI is inside the house. Only outdoor wires are the solenoid wires. Make sure to bury the pipes deep enough so they aren't cracked when you walk on them. Uses Python to control the PI. Uses cron-jobs to run the python script.
